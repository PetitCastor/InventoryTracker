# Inventory Tracker

Ever stashed a rifle in a 2 SCU box three stations ago and forgotten where it went? Same.

Inventory Tracker reads Star Citizen's `Game.log` while you play and works out where your items are. No manual logging, no spreadsheet: just play.

## How it works

Star Citizen never logs a full inventory snapshot. It does log every *movement*: an item leaving one place and arriving in another. The tracker replays those movements in order, so "where are my pants?" becomes a lookup.

It runs as a tray app with a local web UI at `http://localhost:5730`. Browse by system and station, open a container to see what it holds, or follow one item's full history.

The tracker never sees your starting inventory, so it infers everything from the moves. Each result carries a confidence score and, where it applies, a note on what is uncertain (an unconfirmed move, a guessed container location, a possible duplicate). Treat the results as a well-evidenced minimum of what you own and where, not a guarantee.

## Running it

Download **[InventoryTracker.exe](https://github.com/PetitCastor/inventory-tracker/releases/latest/download/InventoryTracker.exe)**. It is a single self-contained file: no installer, no .NET needed. Put it in any writable folder and run it.

The tray app checks for a newer release each time it starts, and updates itself and restarts if it finds one. Console mode (`--scan`) never updates.

```
InventoryTracker.exe                     tray app + UI at http://localhost:5730
InventoryTracker.exe --scan --holdings   console mode, no UI
```

On first launch you pick your Star Citizen log folder (usually pre-filled, since the tracker checks the common install locations) and an inception date. Anything logged before that date is ignored.

## Building it

```
dotnet build InventoryTracker.slnx
dotnet test InventoryTracker.slnx
.\publish.ps1
```

`publish.ps1` builds a single self-contained `dist\InventoryTracker.exe` using the version in the `VERSION` file.

Every merge to `main` cuts a GitHub Release. If `VERSION` is ahead of the latest release (a deliberate minor or major bump), CI releases that version. Otherwise it bumps the patch number by itself.

## Layout

| Path | What's in it |
|---|---|
| `src/Ingest` | Reads `Game.log` and turns lines into typed events |
| `src/Resolve` | Replays events into "what is sitting where" |
| `src/Naming` | Class names to human names, location ids to places |
| `src/Components` | The Blazor UI |
| `src/App` | Tray host, config, shared state |
| `tests/` | Parser, ledger and reader tests, plus the replay reliability study (`tests/InventoryTracker.Tests/Reliability`) |
| `docs/domain` | Reverse-engineering notes on the log format |
| `docs/reliability` | How trustworthy the replay is, measured per pipeline stage, and the plan to improve it |
